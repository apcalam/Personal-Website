      <p>In 2017, I made a website using Wordpress for Young Scholars Prep, a tutoring company I founded.
        I sketched out the design myself, decided on the navigation, pictures, and format of the content.

      <p>Starting in 2016, I volunteered to redesign the website of a local nonprofit orgranization,
        the Literacy Volunteers of Somerset County (LVSC). I worked closely with the Executive Director and
        their graphic designer to redesign the pages because they were too difficult to read and navigate through.
        I redesigned the navigation, rearranged content on pages, and updated information using their
        content manager Joomla. Now I continue to make updates on the website.

      <p>In 2015 I was the Communications Team Captain for my robotics team, where I was in charge of
        maintaining the website and social media. I led a team to redesign the website using Wordpress. I changed the theme
        to a more visually appealing design, changed navigation to make it more intuitive to find relevent information,
        updated outdated content, added more pictures, and created a new blog series to attract more people to visit the
        website.
